I created a project folder named LabExam_LastName_FirstName and initialized it as a Git repository.

I created a index.html file containing a login form with input fields for email and password.

I designed the login page by creating a style.css file and linked it to the HTML to apply styling.

I added a script.js file that validates the form, making sure both fields are filled before allowing login.

I created a home.html file that displays a simple welcome message after successful login.

I created a new Git branch called feature-navbar and added a navigation bar to the home.html page, including "Home" and "Logout" links.

I merged the feature-navbar branch back into the main branch after completing the navbar.

I pushed the entire project to a GitHub repository for backup and submission.

I wrote a README.md file documenting what the project does and the steps I followed.

Finally, I checked the Git log to verify my commits and ran the project in a browser to confirm everything works properly.
